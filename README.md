# LAN-Network-Data-Link-Layer-Simulation
Centralized LAN Network Data Link Layer Protocols simulation on Omnetpp and written in C++

Protocols Used:
* Hamming Codes for Error Detection and Correction
* Word Count for Framing
* Go Back N for synchronization

Error Simulated:
* Modification Error (single bit)
* Duplicate Frame Error
* Drop Frame Error
* Delay Recieving Error

probabilites of errors and number of devices connected to the hub can be changed in the .ini file
